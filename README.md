# 2048
## Project Description
A Java version of the open-source game 2048, taken from a source file and refactored for better encapsulation and a user-friendly UI!
## How do I run this?
1. Create a new JavaFX file 
    - if using IntelliJ, you can create the tutorial Demo file, then switch out the files in the tutorial com.example.demo folder with the files in com.example.game.
    - if using Eclipse, you will have to open the project and download the JavaFX libraries.
2. Run Main!
## How to play
At the beginning of the game, tiles with values of either 2 or 4 will appear. Use the arrow keys to move a tile onto a tile with the same value, which will create a new tile with the sum of the previous two values. Do this until you get a tile with the value 2048!
